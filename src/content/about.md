Hi my name is Nola. I am a certified BCRPA personal trainer, former OrangeTheory Fitness Coach and Healthy Heart Instructor, specializing in working with the older adult community.

I have taught a number of classes from HIIT, core conditioning, boot camps, aqua fit, spin, to chair exercises. Fitness is a big part of my life and I love to share my passion with anyone that will come.

As a mama of four, I know how hard it can be to get back into shape. Balancing work, and the home all the while taking care of the people in your life. The struggle is real. My passion is to see people make fitness and exercise a part of their everyday life and to make it simple.

I have witnessed client after client reach great achievements. And I want you to be the next!
