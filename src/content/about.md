Hi, my name is Nola. I am a certified BCRPA personal trainer, former OrangeTheory Fitness Coach and Healthy Heart Instructor, and I specialize in working with the older adult community.

I have been personal training for 8 years working with all types of fitness levels, athletes, persons of disabilities, post-partum mothers, and even people recovering from injuries and illnesses.

I have taught a number of classes from HIIT, core conditioning, boot camps, aqua fit, spin, to chair exercises. Fitness is a big part of my life and I love to share my passion with everyone.

Balancing work and home life are challenging. My goal is to help you incorporate exercise into your daily life. Whether it is going hard at the gym for muscle gains or exercises to keep you mobile and limber. I can help you achieve your goals and give you the knowledge to add fitness into your daily routine with take-home exercises that you can do anytime, anywhere. As a mother of four, I understand how busy life can be.

**Clients come to Vitality Fitness and get results.**

Vitality Fitness is located in the heart of Willoughby, a community in Langley, BC.
