How it works: 

Packages are paid upfront on assessment day. You are in control. You set the rules for how often or little you wish to train. Your program will be tailored to wherever you wish to train.

Most clients come to train 2 to 3 times per week and have great success. Others choose to purchase a package of personal training sessions, learn the program, and then take it to the gym of their choice. 

\*Note: A minimum of 24 hours' notice is required to cancel your session.
